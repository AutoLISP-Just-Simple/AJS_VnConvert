1.1.3b: Contributed work by Gero Herrmann
 - Added charsets ISC and VNI-MAC for MAC OS
 - Changed Makefile to use ranlib
1.1.3:
 - Cleaned up some code. Use libbyteio library.
 - Added option -q for quiet mode.
 - Both UTF-8 & UTF8 for charset name are now ok.
 - Smarter in writing URL in VIQR mode: no escapes for dots in URLs:
    e.g. http://unikey.sf.net instead of http://unikey\.sf.net
 
1.1.2:
- Supported one more "charset": UVIQR
  UVIQR is used for input of UTF-8 and VIQR mixed together.
